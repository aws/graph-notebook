## Using graph-notebook on Amazon Sagemaker

Amazon Sagemaker Notebooks provide an easy and effective solution for hosting, configuring, and running `graph-notebook` against a graph database. These notebooks also serve as the base platform for [Neptune Workbench](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/graph-notebooks.html). 

If you would like to manually deploy a Neptune Workbench instance via AWS CloudFormation, please see the instructions in the [`neptune-notebook-cloudformation`](https://github.com/aws/graph-notebook/blob/main/additional-databases/sagemaker/neptune-notebook-cloudformation) folder. 

For non-Neptune use cases, you can follow the instructions in the [`sagemaker-notebook-lifecycle`](https://github.com/aws/graph-notebook/blob/main/additional-databases/sagemaker/sagemaker-notebook-lifecycle) folder.
