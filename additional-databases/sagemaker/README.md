## Launching graph-notebook using Amazon SageMaker
You can easily launch instances of graph-notebook on Amazon SageMaker by using a lifecycle configuration. To learn more about lifecycle configurations and how to create one, see [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/notebook-lifecycle-config.html).

Use the sample lifecycle configuration in this folder, [`install-graph-notebook-lc.sh`](install-graph-notebook-lc.sh) ([`install-graph-notebook-lc-cn.sh`](install-graph-notebook-lc-cn.sh) if using `cn-north-1` or `cn-northwest-1` region) or create your own shell script. 

After you create a lifecycle configuration on SageMaker, you can create new notebook instances by specifying a saved lifecycle configuration:
