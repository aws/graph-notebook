## Launching graph-notebook using Amazon SageMaker
You can easily launch instances of graph-notebook on Amazon SageMaker by using a lifecycle configuration. To learn more about lifecycle confgurations and how to create one, check out the documentation [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/notebook-lifecycle-config.html).

You can use the sample lifecycle configuration included in this folder, [`install-graph-notebook-lc.sh`](install-graph-notebook-lc.sh) or create your own shell script.
