Run `%load_ext graph_notebook.magics` at the top of a notebook to enable gremlin magic like `%%gremlin`

Default password is `admin`.

## Example Runs
```sh
docker run --network="host"  -p 8888:8888 -t graph-notebook

# Sharing directories
docker run --network="host"  -p 8889:8889 -p 8888:8888 -v $(pwd)/out:/working 

# For connecting with IAM Auth
docker run -p 8888:8888 \
 -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID \
 -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY \ 
 -e AWS_SESSION_TOKEN \ 
 -e AWS_REGION="us-east-1" \
 graph-notebook
```

Example Notebooks are placed in the `Example Notebooks` sub-directory

Within the Jupyter Notebook you must configure the Notebook settings to account for `localhost` or `remote` connections.

### Example Localhost Connection:
```ipynb
%%graph_notebook_config
    {
        "host": "localhost",
        "port": 8182,
        "ssl": false,
        // Proxy port can be defined without attempting to proxy
        "proxy_port":8182,
        "proxy_host": "",
        "auth_mode": "IAM",
        "aws_region": "us-east-1",
        "load_from_s3_arn": ""
    }
```

### Example Neptune Proxy Connection:
```ipynb
    {
        "host": "clustername.cluster-ididididid.us-east-1.neptune.amazonaws.com",
        "port": 8182,
        "ssl": true,
        "proxy_port": 8182,
        "proxy_host": "host.proxy.com",
        "auth_mode": "IAM",
        "aws_region": "us-east-1",
        "load_from_s3_arn": ""
    }
```
