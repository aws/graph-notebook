    "- Explanatory text authored in Markdown, or\n",
    "- Code that you can run (the programming language depends on the kernel that your server is using), or\n",
    "- The output that is produced when you run the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user interface of a notebook is fairly self-explanatory. You can create a new notebook from the `File` menu. Once you have a notebook open, you can edit a cell by double-clicking on its interior. If you are editing a Markdown cell, you can render its HTML by \"running\" it. You can run a selected cell using the `Run` button on the toolbar (if the toolbar is hidden, use the `View` menu to toggle it on). The `Edit` and `Cell` menus provide a large number of operations, and `Keyboard Shortcuts` on the `Help` menu displays a long list of commands with corresponding key shortcuts.\n",

    "By default, the workbench uses the IPython 3 kernel. It also provides a number of useful extensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notebook cell 'magic' extensions in the IPython 3 kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "- `%%sparql` - Executes a SPARQL query against your configured database endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `%%gremlin` - Executes a Gremlin query against your database using web sockets. The results are similar to what the Gremlin console would return.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `%%opencypher`/`%%oc` - Executes an openCypher query against your database. By default, the HTTPS endpoint is used. The `bolt` mode can be specified to instead run openCypher queries via the Bolt protocol.\n",

    "\n",
    "- `%load` - Invokes the [Neptune bulk loader](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/bulk-load.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `%graph_notebook_config` - Returns a JSON object that contains connection information for your host.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `%seed` - Provides a form to add data to your graph without the use of a bulk loader. Several PropertyGraph and RDF datasets are already included with graph-notebook. Alternatively, you can load from files on your local disk by providing the language of the datatype and the full path to a file, or a directory containing at least one of these files.\n",
