Once you have a notebook open, you can edit a cell by double-clicking on its interior. If you are editing a Markdown cell, you can render its HTML by \"running\" it. You can run a selected cell using the `Run` button on the toolbar (if the toolbar is hidden, use the `View` menu to toggle it on). The `Edit` and `Cell` menus provide a large number of operations, and `Keyboard Shortcuts` on the `Help` menu displays a long list of commands with corresponding key shortcuts.\n",
