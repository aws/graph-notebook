    "\n",
    "In supply chain management, a network of process steps is drawn to minimize product delivery time from production to shipping. Up to this day, optimizations in process steps are mostly carried out by staff members, who can be prone to errors and under-optimized solutions. Moreover, it takes them a reasonable amount of time to design an optimal schedule when they could have been utilized for processes requiring more expertise and knowledge with an automated process scheduling the supply chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll learn how to start Memgraph, connect to it and run Cypher queries to explore the supply chain and learn more about the power of graphs in that domain. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Connect to Memgraph<a name=\"connect-to-memgraph\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "[Memgraph](https://memgraph.com/) is an open-source in-memory graph database built for highly performant and advanced analytical insights. Memgraph is Neo4j Bolt protocol compatible and uses the standardized Cypher query language. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a quick start, run the following command in your terminal to start the Memgraph Platform in a Docker container: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker run -it -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 -p 3000:3000 -e MEMGRAPH=\"--bolt-server-name-for-init=Neo4j/\" memgraph/memgraph-platform\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above command starts the Memgraph database, MAGE (graph algorithms library) and Memgraph Lab (visual user interface). For additional instructions on setting up and running Memgraph locally, refer to the [Memgraph documentation](https://memgraph.com/docs/memgraph/installation). Connection to the Graph Notebook works if the `--bolt-server-name-for-init` setting is modified. For more information on changing configuration settings, refer to our [how-to guide](https://memgraph.com/docs/memgraph/how-to-guides/config-logs).\n",
