    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Northwind Database\n",
    "The Northwind database is a fictional database used for educational and testing purposes. The Northwind database is often used in the context of database management systems, particularly in the study of SQL (Structured Query Language) queries and relational database concepts.\n",
    "The Northwind database is designed with tables representing entities like customers, orders, products, employees, suppliers and others, along with relationships between these entities. It includes sample data that mimics a company's operations, allowing users to practice querying and managing data in a relational database environment.\n",
    "It's worth noting that the Northwind Use Case may vary slightly depending on the context or the specific implementation used in educational materials, but it generally serves as a practical example for learning and testing database-related concepts.\n",
    "In this demonstration we are going to use the RDF Knowledge Graph version of the Northwind database to provide hands-on experience on Amazon Neptune by executing use case stories (SPARQL queries) on a Jupyter Notebook. It's a practical, learn-as-you-go experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### EKGF Guiding Principals\n",
    "The Enterprise Knowledge Graph Forum (EKGF) is now part of the Object Management Group (OMG).\n",
    "The EKGF was established to define best practice and mature the marketplace for EKG adoption and provides 10 guiding principles which are intended to provide guidelines for the development and deployment of an Enterprise Knowledge Graph (EKG). The principles emphasise shared meaning and content reuse that are the cornerstone of operating in complex and interconnected environments.\n",
    "The Northwind Use Case demonstrates Principle 7, which says:\n",
    "*All artefacts around and information in the EKG are linked to defined and prioritised use cases. Nothing in the EKG exists without a known business justification and purpose.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### SPARQLÂ \n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstration covers a great deal of the syntax and semantics of the SPARQL query language, including FILTER, UNION, LIMIT, OFFSET, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, DISTINCT, OPTIONAL, BIND, BOUND, MINUS, FILTER NOT EXISTS, INSERT, DELETE, DESCRIBE, CONSTRUCT, REGEX, CONTAINS, HAVING, as well as String Matching and Manipulation, Aggregation Functions, Subqueries, and Property Paths, among others.\n",
    "For more detail information on the stories below, please refer to this [Medium article](https://medium.com/@mbarbieri77/northwind-use-case-on-amazon-neptune-0e85378307a7)."

You may also need to set up the appropriate permissions to the Neptune Cluster so it can  read files from the S3 bucket.
