    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "An identity graph provides a single unified view of customers and prospects by linking multiple identifiers such as cookies, device identifiers, IP addresses, email IDs, and internal enterprise IDs to a known person or anonymous profile using privacy-compliant methods. Typically, identity graphs are part of a larger identity resolution architecture. Identity resolution is the process of matching human identity across a set of devices used by the same person or a household of persons for the purposes of building a representative identity, or known attributes, for targeted advertising.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following notebook walks you through a sample solution for identity graph and how it can be used within a larger identity resolution architecture using an open dataset and the use of a graph database, Amazon Neptune. In this notebook, we also show a number of data visualizations that allow one to better understand the structure of an identity graph and the aspects of an identity resolution dataset and use case. We also showcase some additional use cases that can be exposed using this particular dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this notebook is derived from the **CIKM Cup 2016 Track 1: Cross-Device Entity Linking Challenge**.  This dataset contains anonymized clickstream data for a set of anonymized user IDs representing the same user across multiple devices, as well as hashed site URLs and HTML titles those users visited.  For example 'http://www.amazon.com' could be represented as 'c94174b63350fd53' in this dataset and 'http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers' could be represented as 'c94174b63350fd53/1e8deebfc8e36e85/2215e2a3f89eeba7' where each of the directories in the url are hashed as well.  In a similar method, usernames, cookies, and device IDs are also hashed.  To make this dataset more interesting to use, we have added additional features to this data using the [python faker](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/) library.  Combining the CIKM dataset with the manufactured data, we have stitched the data together to create the following graph data model:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/887309d048beef83ad3eabf2a79a64a389ab1c9f/2020/05/06/Building-a-customer-identity-graph-3.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This data model could be used as the starting point for your own identity graph. In most cases, an organization will have data related to website visits, click events, IP addresses, and some combination of anonymous users and registered (signed-on) users.  Anonymous users in this data model are represented as \"transient IDs\" and known users are represented as \"persistent IDs\".  The process of linking anonymous users to known users is accomplished through a process called [identity (or entity) resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_linkage#Entity_resolution).  We have assumed here that identity resolution has already taken place and we are storing the relationships between the anonymous users and their resolved known users.  The process of identity resolution can involve both deterministic patterns (such as matching users coming from the same public IP address within a certain time frame) or through more probabilistic means (using machine learning).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loading the Identity Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started with our Identity Graph, we will load a set of data from the data model shown above into our Neptune cluster.  Run the following two cells to download and load this data.  It will take approximately 5-6 minutes to complete this next step.  This will load approximately 120,000 clickstream events with their corresponding user information.  The first cell will download the data from S3 into your notebook instance.  The second cell uses the `%seed` command to load this data to your Neptune cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "***NOTE: If using this notebook in a locally installed deployment of graph-notebook, you may need to copy the contents of the first cell below, add `sudo` to the beginning of each line, and run these commands in a bash terminal window. Otherwise, you may get 'permission denied' errors.  If running this notebook in a Neptune Notebook or SageMaker Notebook instance, this will work as is.***"

    "## Example Use Cases and Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections we will showcase the many ways in which identity graphs are used.  Many of these use cases focus around better understanding user behavior as users interact with an online platform.  These insights provide you with a means of servicing customers in a targeted manner or converting potential product interest into sales opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cross-Device Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advertisers want to find out information about user interests to provide an accurate targeting. The data should be based on the activity of the user across all devices.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are hosting a web platform and collecting clickstream data as users browse your site or use your mobile app.  In the majority of situations, users using your platform will be anonymous (or non-registered or logged in users).  However, these anonymous users may be linked to other known users in that have used our platform before.  We can join (or resolve) the identity of the anonymous user with attributes we know about existing users to make some assumptions (based off of known user behavior and heuristics) in order to know more about this anonymous user.  We can then use this information to target the user with advertising, special offers, discounts, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use an example where we have an anonymous user id ('ed4982b00e323383583f30236e5b1f11').  We want to know more about this user and if they are linked to other users on our platform.  This anonymous user is considered a \"transient ID\" in our graph data model (see picture above).  Assuming this user does not have a link to a known user, or \"persistent ID\", how might we find connections from this transient ID to other known user IDs?  Looking at the data model, you can see that \"transient ID\" vertices in our graph are connected to \"IP Address\" vertices.  We can traverse across \"IP Address\" vertices to get to other linked \"transient IDs\" that might be linked to a known user.  Let's do that in the following graph query.  Run the following cell, and then click on the Graph tab to see an output displaying the path from the anonymous user to the known user:"

    "Identity graphs are a key component in being able to analyze consumer behavior and provide deep insights on how best to interact with potential customers.  In this notebook, we walked through three potential use cases for building an identity graph. Cross-device graphs discuss how to unify user IDs across multiple devices and how to build household subgraphs. Targeted promotions showcase an example of isolating a subgraph of undecided consumers for targeted discounts. Lastly, audience segmentation discusses ways to identify a set of unique users based on all interactions with the brand through its websites. The patterns displayed above are just a small subset of how identity graphs can be leveraged."
