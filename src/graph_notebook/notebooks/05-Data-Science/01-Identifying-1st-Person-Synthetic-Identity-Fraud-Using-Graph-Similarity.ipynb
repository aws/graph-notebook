    "# Identifying 1st Person/Synthetic Identity Fraud Using Graph Similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the financial industry, an organization can expect to lose 3-6%, and up to 10%, of its [business to fraudulent activities](http://www.crowe.ie/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/The-Financial-Cost-of-Fraud-2019.pdf).  Fraudulent activities not only impact financial aspects, but victims often have negative views of the company, leading to negative market sentiment.  Overall, these fraudulent activities have a significant impact on a business, in terms of both consumer confidence and bottom-line revenue.  Due to the impact of these illicit activities on the bottom line, companies expend significant time and money to detect and prevent fraud.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with fraud, there are two main components to a robust fraud system., fraud detection and fraud prevention.  In fraud detection component of a system, the main goals are to develop a system and methodology that allows for the rapid discovery of fraudulent activities.   This usually involves a posterior evaluation of data, such as transaction, users, credit cards, etc. to determine what patterns or combinations represent actual fraud.  This process usually involves a human-in-the-loop system where automated processes flag likely or potential fraudulent activities, which are then evaluated by an expert in the domain to determine the legitimacy, or ill-legitimacy, of the activities flagged.  The output of this process is a set of known and evolving patterns of fraud that are fed into a fraud prevention system.   Generally, this consists of a real-time system that compares a transaction, or a set of transactions, against the known fraudulent patterns identified by the fraud detection system.  The objective of this fraud prevention system is to reduce and prevent fraudulent activities from occurring in the first place. \n",

    "## Challenges of Detecting Fraud\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with fraud, it is often helpful to understand some challenges of finding fraudulent activities when looking into data.  Often this is aided by first understanding the definition and nature of fraud.  While there are many definitions of what fraud is my favorite is:\n",
    "\n",
    "[Fraud is an uncommon, well-considered, imperceptibly concealed, time-evolving and often carefully organized crime which appears in many types of forms .](https://www.amazon.com/Analytics-Descriptive-Predictive-Network-Techniques/dp/1119133122)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This definition highlights the complex nature of the problems we must address when working on fraud systems.  First, fraud is *uncommon*.  Within any system of recorded transactions, only a small fraction of these transactions consist of fraudulent or illicit activities.  The sparse nature of these illicit activities complicates the nature of identifying these activities.  Second, fraud is *well-considered* and *imperceptibly concealed,* meaning that fraudulent activities are rarely impulsive activities.  Most fraudulent activities, at least at scale, involve multiple parties colluding together to perform actions specifically designed to exploit weaknesses in the system and elude detection.  Finally, fraud is *time-evolving*.  Fraudsters are continuously evolving and adapting their techniques as detection and prevention improve in an endless game of hide and seek.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these challenges in mind, many fraud detection systems take a multifaceted approach to identifying illicit activities.   In this notebook, we will focus on the use of social networks implicitly found in fraud data to identify fraud rings committing illicit transactions using a guilt-by-association approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "First-person fraud occurs when a user supplies false information to a company.  Synthetic identity fraud is when users combine real and fake information to create a new synthetic identity.  This is a very common type of fraud that is rampant in most financial institutions.  Solving this type of fraud using a graph relies heavily on using entity resolution type techniques combined with graph analysis to identify similar or connected entities."

But with fraud detection it's important to be able to link accounts based on shared features, and to find related accounts at query time based on one or more shared features. Hence, our fraud detection application graph data model stores each feature as a separate vertex.

For more details on modelling shared features as vertices, see Relating entities through their attributes at query time.\n",
