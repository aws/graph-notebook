    "# Logistics Analysis using a Transportation Network\n",
    "\n",
    "For any company that deals with moving goods from one location to another, the logistical challenges and associated costs of moving people and goods from one location to another represent a significant amount of effort and resources.  Companies often employ a variety of route optimization techniques to optimize both the costs and efficiency of their transportation logistics.  When dealing with route logistics, there are a few main points of data that come into play including time, cost, distance, etc. Using graphs to represent the connections between data within these logistics systems provides a robust way to represent these attributes.  Graphs allow us to represent attributes of connections as properties of those connections, which is a natural way to store data for a logistics system.  Graphs also provide advantages in logistics systems as they enable certain types of graph algorithms, specifically around path finding, to drive insights that can feed into route optimizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Route optimization can take many forms, be it minimizing distance, maximizing load, minimizing cost, maximizing speed, or balancing multiple factors to achieve an optimized solution.  In this notebook, we will look at the types of inputs that graphs can help provide to these optimizations.\n",

These types of questions are ones where logistics graphs and graph analytics excel through the use of a category of graph algorithms known as path finding algorithms.  Path finding algorithms are a set of algorithms that traverse through a graph from a start to an end node to determine the \"most efficient\" path in terms of the number of connections or a weight, which can represent a relative attribute of the connection such as time, distance, cost, capacity, complexity, etc.\n",

Deadhorse, AK is a small community in the far northern reaches of Alaska's Prudhoe Bay, approximately 495 miles (~800 kms) from the nearest city.
